/* ======================= PRICE AND TERMS (PRICING v2, Oct 16 2026): the ONE place to change them =======================
   Michelle, Oct 16 2026: Good/Better/Best tiers, each paid in full at signing, then the $99/month care plan
   (first month free) on EVERY tier. Launch timing everywhere: "0–3 business days".
   Each card's button opens agreement/?tier=<id>; the agreement then states that tier, its price and what is included,
   and pays that tier's own live Stripe link (payLink). vertical "tax" carries the busy-season pitch on tiers 2 and 3;
   "trade" (contractors) carries none. The cards are drawn by /p/assets/tiers.js from this block.
   Live Stripe links: Fast Track plink_1UR06vJQOpmS2MxAsdNI7CYH · Automator plink_1URAcEJQOpmS2MxAWYSGsq93 ·
   Client Machine plink_1URAcFJQOpmS2MxAmp8VUBci. Prices: 1497 / 2197 / 2997. */
